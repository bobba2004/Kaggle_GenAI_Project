# Kaggle_GenAI_Project

Gen AI Project: Codebase Q&A Assistant Idea: 
A tool that answers questions about a GitHub repo by doing RAG over code files and README. 
Example: “How is auth handled?” or “Where is the database config?” 
Stack: Parse repo → chunk code + docs → embed + RAG. 
Bonus: Add clickable links to code lines in answers.
